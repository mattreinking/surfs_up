# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Project
W. Avy wants information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. He wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Resources
- Visual Studio Code  
- Python  
- SQLite  
- Weather data: hawaii.sqlite

## Results
- Our data shows there is not a huge difference in temperature comparing June and December having only about a 3-4 degree average temperature difference.  
- Despite June having a higher sample of data, it does not seem to have a meaningful impact on the temperature difference throughout the year in comparison to December. June had a minimum temperature of 64&deg;F while December had a minimum of 56&deg;F. The difference being only 9&deg;F is not a stark difference in how cold it can be in Oahu.
- The difference between the minimum and maximum temperature is 21-27&deg;F. Based on the large set of data we have, this seems to be the pattern Oahu's temperature tyically fluctuates. This shows there are not huge adjustments peoples' bodies will have to make to compensate for cold temperatures throughout the year.

## Summary
Based on our results above, ice cream is definitely sustainable year-round. The trends we examined between June and December which are generally agreed to be the hottest and coldest months, respectively, of the year show there is not a meaningful difference in temperature. Another factor to consider would be the precipitation data. Analyzing based on how often it rains would be another aspect to research. Rain will have a much heavier impact on business than temperature will. Organizing th data by station would be another effective query. The research would give better insight into the consistency of the data. One station may be supplying most of the data which could potentially skew our data hence giving us inaccurate results.
